This project is a pure C# translation of [enet](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet), where native sockets are replaced with [NanoSockets](https://github.com/nxrighthere/NanoSockets). 

You can build binaries using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Molth/NanoSockets/actions).

⚠️ iOS builds are not included by default.
