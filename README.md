This project is a pure C# translation of [enet](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet), no binaries.

Where udp implementation: [NativeSockets](https://github.com/Molth/NativeSockets).

## Why?

The original ENet relies on platform-specific native binaries,

which poses challenges for cross-platform distribution and deployment.

This project eliminates that dependency while preserving full compatibility with the original implementation.
